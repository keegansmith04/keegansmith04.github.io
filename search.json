    "text": "Stealing bases is something that has been seen in college baseball for close to 70 years and has proven to have many benefits. Over time, it has become a strategic tool used to advance runners. It is typically used in a “small ball” sense with a focus on gaining runs through smaller calculated plays like bunts rather than normal hits. It is also seen as a major way to disrupt another team’s rhythm and boost your own team’s morale, creating a more energetic and fast-paced game. Stealing bases is the key to getting runners in scoring position and can make a real difference in close games. The real question is, do these stolen bases and extra runs really put teams over the edge and give them the win? This blog will analyze some of the top teams in college baseball this season to truly see if more steals means more wins.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nsteals &lt;- read_csv(\"baseball steals 2025 - Sheet1.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntopsteals &lt;- steals |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    AvgSB = mean(SB)\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(AvgSB)) |&gt;\n  top_n(10)\ntopsteals |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    AvgSB = \"Total Team Steals\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"The Virgina Military Institute Keydets lead the charge.\",\n    subtitle = \"Take a look at the 10 teams dominating the bases.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\ntab_source_note(md(\"**By**: Keegan Smith | **Source:** NCAA\")) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#a71f23\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"VMI (SoCon)\")\n  )|&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Virgina Military Institute Keydets lead the charge.\n\n\nTake a look at the 10 teams dominating the bases.\n\n\nTeam\nTotal Team Steals\n\n\n\n\nVMI (SoCon)\n164\n\n\nWofford (SoCon)\n104\n\n\nMount St. Mary's (MAAC)\n93\n\n\nSouthern U.

From the start of the season to April 4, 2025, the Keydets averaged 5.466 steals per game. Wofford comes in a not so close second place with 104 steals and the rest of the teams trail farther behind with less than 100 stolen bases on the season. Continuing this season after 37 games VMI is still at the top of the leaderboard with 184 stolen bases. The other top 10 teams have also continued their outstanding performance and remained in the top 10.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1234)\nstealsconference &lt;- steals |&gt; \n  mutate(Team = gsub(\"(FL)\", \"FL\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Team = gsub(\"(NY)\", \"NY\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Team = gsub(\"(PA)\", \"PA\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Team = gsub(\"(OH)\", \"OH\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Team = gsub(\"(CA)\", \"CA\", Team, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt;\n  separate(Team, into = c(\"Team\", \"Conference\"), sep = \"\\\\(\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Conference = gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference)) |&gt;\n  separate(`W-L`, into = c(\"Wins\", \"Losses\", \"Ties\"), sep = \"-\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Wins = as.numeric(Wins))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmoststeals &lt;- stealsconference |&gt;\n  filter(SB &gt; 80)\nggplot() + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=stealsconference, \n    aes(x=SB, y=Conference), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_beeswarm(\n    data=moststeals, \n    aes(x=SB, y=Conference), color=\"#009CDE\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = moststeals,\n    aes(x=SB, y=Conference, label = Team)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Total stolen bases this season\", \n    y=\"Conference\", \n    title=\"The Power 5 conferences are not so powerful when it comes to steals.\", \n    subtitle=\"Many of the leading teams with stolen bases are from smaller conferences.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By: Keegan Smith\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you think of powerhouse teams in baseball, your mind typically goes to a school in one of the Power 5 conferences however, this is not the case when looking at the statistics for stolen bases. Of the top 10 teams with the most stolen bases, not a single one of them is from the Power 5. The Southern Conference (SoCon), Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC), Coastal Athletic Association (CAA), Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), and the Big East are all standouts when it comes to stolen bases. Each of these conferences has at least one team with more than 80 steals so far this season while the Power 5 doesn’t have any teams in this range.\n\n\nCode\nwins &lt;- stealsconference |&gt;\n  filter(\n    str_trim(Team) == \"VMI\" |\n      str_trim(Team) == \"Wofford\" |\n      str_trim(Team) == \"Mount St. Mary's\" |\n      str_trim(Team) == \"Georgia\" |\n      str_trim(Team) == \"Arkansas\"|\n      str_trim(Team) == \"Tennessee\" |\n      str_trim(Team) ==\"LSU\" |\n      str_trim(Team) == \"Clemson\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=stealsconference, aes(x=Wins, y=SB), color= \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=wins, aes(x=Wins, y=SB), color=\"#009CDE\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=wins, aes(x=Wins, y=SB, label=Team)) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Wins\", \n    y=\"Stolen Bases\", \n    title=\"You win some, you lose some, but do you steal some?\", \n    subtitle=\"The top teams in the nation are at the bottom of the leaderboard for stolen bases.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By: Keegan Smith\"\n    )+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the highest ranked teams this season such as Arkansas, Georgia, and Clemson although they have the most wins, they are average at best when it comes to stolen bases. The same could be said when looking at the teams with the most steals, they are sitting near the middle of the pack when it comes to the number of wins they have this season.\nAfter researching and looking at the data it can be said that having more stolen bases does not make that much of an impact on the number of wins a team has throughout a season. Although stealing does put runners in scoring position they are often left on base, not leading to an extra run or even a win. Overall, stolen bases are not one of the key deciding factors in winning or losing a game."
